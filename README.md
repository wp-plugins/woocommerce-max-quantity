WooCommerce Max Quantity
========================

Set a universal limit for the max quantity, per product, that can be added to cart. Does not require customers to log in.

WooCommerce Max Quantity is an extension for [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) that lets you set a max limit for the number of items that can be added to the cart. It's a universal limit, meaning this limit affects all products in your WooCommerce store. 

The limit is per product, not per the entire cart. 

This works for guest buyers, as well as logged-in buyers.

To set the number, go to your WordPress dashboard. Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Inventory tab. Scroll down to "Maximum Quantity Limit Per Product". Set your desired limit there.
