Set a universal limit for the max quantity, per product, that can be added to cart. Does not require customers to log in.

== Description ==
WooCommerce Max Quantity is an extension for [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) that lets you set a max limit for the number of items that can be added to the cart. It's a universal limit, meaning this limit affects all products in your WooCommerce store. 

**NOTE:** This plugin only works with "Simple" products. **It does NOT work with products that have "variations".**

The limit is per product, not per the entire cart. 

This works for guest buyers, as well as logged-in buyers.

To set the number, go to your WordPress dashboard. Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Products tab. Click "Inventory". Scroll down to "Maximum Quantity Limit Per Product". Set your desired limit there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't you add support for products with variations? =

I don't have the time at the moment to add it with enough options for backwards compatibility for those who do not want this feature. (There are those who do not prefer this feature. For example, if you want to limit sales to 3 T-shirts, regardless of T-shirt size.) I may add this feature in the future, when I get time. You are welcome to hack away [on Github](https://github.com/isabelc/Woocommerce-Max-Quantity).
