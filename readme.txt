Set a universal limit for the max quantity, per product, that can be added to cart. Does not require customers to log in.

== Description ==
WooCommerce Max Quantity is an extremely simple extension for [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) that lets you set a max limit for the number of items that can be added to the cart. It's simple because there is only 1 option (your desired maximum number). It's a universal limit, meaning this limit affects each product in your WooCommerce store.

**NOTE:**
This plugin only works with "Simple" products. For products that have "variations", you can try [this fork by thekillerdev](https://github.com/thekillerdev/WooCommerce-Max-Quantity) instead, which he modified to work with products with variations.
**END NOTE**

The limit is per product, not per the entire cart. 

This works for guest buyers, as well as logged-in buyers.

To set the number, go to your WordPress dashboard. Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Products tab. Click "Inventory". Scroll down to "Maximum Quantity Limit Per Product". Set your desired limit there.

**Languages**
Includes `.mo` and `.po` translations for Dutch (thanks to Martijn Heesters), French, German (thanks @tofuSCHNITZEL), Hindi, and Spanish languages. Also includes a `.pot` file to make more translations.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't you add support for products with variations? =

I don't have the time at the moment to add it with the proper option to disable it for those who do not want this feature. (There are those who do not prefer this feature. For example, if you want to limit sales to 3 T-shirts, regardless of T-shirt size.) I may add this feature in the future, when I get time.
